2. **Roadmap Generation**  
   Upon role selection (or direct role query), the app dynamically constructs a flowchart outlining essential learning paths and checkpoints.

3. **Interactive Details**  
   Each node in the flowchart is clickable, revealing definitions, learning resources and estimated timelines.
